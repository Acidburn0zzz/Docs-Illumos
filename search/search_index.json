It began as a fork of the former\n\nOpenSolaris\n operating system.\n\n\nOur goal is to foster open development of technologies for the 21\nst\n century\nwhile building on a twenty-year heritage, but free from the oversight of a\nsingle corporate entity and the resulting challenges thereof.\n\n\nWhile our code base has a long history and many engineering traditions attached\nto it, our development processes are being reinvented in an attempt to remove\nbarriers while maintaining consistently high code quality.\n\n\nHow do I download the software?\n\n\nThe source code developed by the project is a fork of the Sun/Oracle code base\nreferred to as \"OS/Net\" or \"ON\" (short for Operating System/Networking). It is\nthe home of the technologies that previously defined OpenSolaris and Solaris,\nsuch as the kernel, network stack, filesystems, and device drivers, and all of\nthe basic userland libraries and applications.\n\n\nThe illumos code base forms the foundation of \ndistributions\n.\nTo use the operating system, just download and install one of the\ndistributions.\n\n\nTo download the source code, follow the section on Git or Mercurial in \nHow To\nBuild illumos\n. You can also \nbrowse and search the\nillumos code online\n.\n\n\nIs illumos free software (open source)?\n\n\nThe bulk of the illumos source code is available under the Common Development\nand Distribution License (CDDL), an OSI-approved free software license based on\nthe Mozilla Public License (MPL).\n\n\nThere are some components with other licenses including BSD and MIT. We also\ninclude some software with the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the\nLesser/Library General Public License (LGPL).\n\n\nThere still remain some binary-only, closed source components that we inherited\nfrom Oracle which we are working to replace. Unlike OpenSolaris, we do not\nrequire a closed source compiler.\n\n\nIs illumos a Nexenta or Joyent project?\n\n\nillumos was initiated by then-employees of Nexenta in collaboration with former\nOpenSolaris community members and volunteers. While companies including\nNexenta, Joyent, and Delphix sponsor some of the work in illumos, the project\nis independent of their business decisions. illumos exists as a common base for\nmultiple commercial and community distributions.\n\n\nIs illumos a community project?\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nMultiple community groups and interests (including people like you!) are\nstakeholders in the project, and anyone and everyone is welcome to\n\ncontribute\n.\n\n\nHow do I start contributing?\n\n\nillumos thrives on the efforts of its contributors. Have a look at the guide on\n\nHow To Contribute\n if you want to submit code.\n\n\nIf you want to help in other ways then have a look at the \nMailing\nLists\n.\n\n\nMost of the developers can be found on \nIRC\n\nand you're invited to drop in and say \"hi!\"\n\n\nHow do I build illumos?\n\n\nSee \nHow To Build illumos\n.\n\n\nHow do I build a distribution based on illumos?\n\n\nOpenSolaris was historically difficult to build as a distribution because it\nwas assembled by many separate teams at Sun. The illumos community\ndistributions are working to make this easier.\n\n\nSome distributions have\n\ndocumented\n their build\nprocesses.\n\n\nIs illumos compatible with Solaris/OpenSolaris?\n\n\nillumos is very likely to be compatible with Solaris/OpenSolaris binaries and\ndrivers before Oracle closed the gate in 2010. After that, all bets are off.\nSolaris 10 update 11, and Solaris 11, and beyond, may contain incompatible\nchanges.\n\n\nWhat changes does illumos maintain?\n\n\n\n\nOpen internationalization libraries and data files.\n\n\nOpen replacements for closed binaries.\n\n\nCode that Oracle may choose to no longer maintain.\n\n\nCommunity enhancements to critical technologies like DTrace and ZFS.\n\n\nNew open technologies.\n\n\nPatches/bug-fixes we have independently developed, including security fixes.\n\n\nChanges to ease community development.\n\n\n...and more!\n\n\n\n\nDo you track Oracle changes?\n\n\nWe originally intended to closely follow upstream changes, but became a fork by\nnecessity because Oracle's software is no longer open source. We now represent\nthe open future of the code base after Sun.\n\n\nWill you work on sending illumos changes upstream?\n\n\nWe would like Oracle to use changes from illumos, as long as they are willing\nto abide by the open source license for our code. Where we use code from other\nfree software projects, we also respect their licenses and keep the source\nopen.\n\n\nWhy did you announce the project after it was set up and much of the code written?\n\n\nThis decision was made for multiple reasons. The signal to noise ratio in the\nOpenSolaris community had grown low, and announcing the project would have\ndistracted the developers from actual code and contribution. Most vocal members\ntalked about opening the code rather than writing it. illumos chose the\nopposite. Before the formal announcement, we reached out to developers in the\ncommunity and solicited their help and participation.\n\n\nAnd the name illumos?\n\n\nWe started off with the codename \"FreeON\", and later realized it is used by an\nexisting project. We finally settled on illumos, after many hours of\nsuggestions and counter-suggestions. illumos (pronounced i-llu-MOS and written\nin lowercase) ties in with Sun and light.

Thank you for joining us. My name is Garrett D\nAmore. Hopefully\neveryone is hearing this. We had some technology challenges such as, such as it\ngoes in our industry, and I apologise for the late start but here we are\nanyway.\n\nSo Illumos. First off I do want to point out before we get started, that there\nis a Q \n A window in the Go2 webinar screen and Anil who is helping me out\nhere, is monitoring that. You can ask questions there and he will forward them\nto me. We also have a backchannel on IRC if you go to irc.freenode.net and the\nback channel is #illumos. I-L-L-U-M-O-S, and Anil\ns monitoring that as well,\nand he\nll let me know if there\ns pertinent questions I should address. I will\ntry to address those questions at the end, however.\n\n[Slide 1, 1:06]\n\nSo, without further adieu, let\ns go ahead and continue. So, thanks for joining\nus. I think that the topic there on the first page slide, hopefully everybody\nsees it. By the way if you aren\nt able to see the slides now, we will be\nposting them up, excuse me Anil have you already posted those? Ok, so Anil with\npost them momentarily. So, hopefully you can get them, and they\nll be on the\nwebsite at www.illumos.org. Just looking at that font on the slide, and realize\nthe \nI\n really doesn\nt stand out vary differently from the \nL.\n I apologize for\nthat, it\ns I-L-L. And our topic is \nHope and Light Springs Anew.\n\n\nSo, the name... well first off I hope everyone understands that this\npresentation is targeted towards the OpenSolaris audience so I didn\nt really go\ninto a lot of background there. It will become clear as we go on. If you are\nhere asking about Windows or something else you\nre probably in the wrong\nconference call.\n\n[Slide 2, 2:19]\n\nSo what\ns in a name? First \nIllum\n from Latin for \nLight\n and \nOS\n for\n\nOperating System.\n However even though I printed it out this way on the slide,\nnow we\nve been spelling it all one word with any unusual spellings, so\nI-L-L-U-M-O-S, with only the \nI\n capitalized.\n\n[Slide 3, 2:41]\n\nSo, actually what is this project about? Well the first thing is that the\nproject is designed here to solve a key problem, and that is that not all of\nOpenSolaris is really open source. And there\ns a lot of other potential\nconcerns in the community, but this one is really kind of a core one, and from\nsolving this, I think a lot of other issues can be solved. So the critical\ncomponents of OpenSolaris. Well, first off I guess I should say that most of\nthe important parts of OpenSolaris are, for booting at least and for building a\nfoundation block for the OS/Net consolidation, out of that consolidation it\ns\nnearly completely open source, except for a few pieces. One of the most\nstriking pieces is this part called \nlibc-i18n,\n which is a component you need\nto build a working C library. It\ns a substantial percentage of libc is tied up\nin that libc-i18n, in some cases because it\ns i18n code, in other cases because\nof dependencies and well dependencies is probably the best way to put it.\n\nThe NFS lock manager, of course, there\ns the crypto framework, a number of\nreally important drivers. mpt I listed here is a pretty famous one its for a\npretty popular series of HBAs from LSI. But there\ns a lot of other drivers that\nare closed source, and in fact even some key platform code, although that\ns for\nthe most port an issue for the SPARC port. Most of the critical platform code\nfor x86 is open, in fact I can\nt think of anything critical that\ns closed.\nThis list is by no means exhaustive, but it\ns a good start.\n\nSo the problem with the fact that not all of this source is open is that it\nreally does present some big challenges to anyone downstream or who depends on\nOS/Net or consequently OpenSolaris and of course this involves Nexenta,\nBelinux, Schillix these are all derivative distributions from the original\nsource from Oracle. And this problem is not new to the industry; some years ago\nApple had done the community a great favor by opening a bunch of their code in\nthe form of Darwin. However I think you can Google around for MacOS X and\nDarwin and see the end result of that. And that is, the end result, I think,\nthat we would all like to avoid.\n\n[Slide 4, 5:32]\n\nSo there\ns a lot of good stuff, with all the other issues going on with the\ncommunity that\ns built up around the code. First off there\ns technology in\nthe code, zfs, dtrace, crossbow, zones, I think everyone who\ns familiar with\nOpensolaris will recognize this stuff, and if you don\nt, Google will readily\nfill you in with lots and lots of detail on all of these technologies, and this\nis just a brief list of some of the big names. There\ns a lot of others beyond\nthis. And of course the community behind these technologies is made up of a\nnumber of just incredible engineers, I\nve been fortunate to work with some of\nthe brightest people on the planet, I believe, on Solaris and SunOS code. And\nwe are also backed by an outstanding set of enthusiasts, and our eco-system\nreally is quite vibrant, particularly in light of some of the other challenges\nit continues to be so vibrant. This I think says a lot. And of course the other\nthing is that it\ns not all closed. In fact, the vast majority of the code is\nindeed open. So the problem of, the problem faced to resolve this is actually\nquite tractable.\n\n[Slide 5, 7:06]\n\nTechnology issues, there it goes, alright. I apologise. OK. So around this\neffort. I talked a little about the issue of the code. To elaborate a little\nbit further, what we\nve done is taken OS/Net, this consolidation which really\nmakes up the kernel and a bunch of critical system utilities and made a child\nof it, and this is really a source code management type term but what it means\nis that it has an ancestry relationship with the upstream which in this case is\nthe code from Oracle, and we track the upstream very closely, and we also have\nthe goal of being 100% compatible with the code from Oracle. I say ABI\ncompatible, what that means is that the idea is that you can take an\napplication that is compiled and runs well on Solaris, and the same exact\napplication compiles and runs on Illumos, so that is an important point.\n\nWe also, the idea is no closed code. There\ns a fully open libc, I would want to\nhave a fully open kernel, and fully open drivers. As you\nll see we are not all\nthe way there yet but we made really good progress, and continue to work on\nthis. The other idea is that this project then becomes a repository where we\ncan take changes from contributors that for a variety of reasons might be\nunacceptable to Oracle, and I can detail all those later, maybe in Q \n A or\nmaybe separately. There\ns a lot of potential possibilities here, and as long as\nwe don\nt really break the idea of ABI compatibility with Solaris and we don\nt\ndiverge needlessly from the upstream ON consolidation, there\ns a lot of room\nfor innovation.\n\n[Slide 6, 9:19]\n\nSo the focus of Illumos is really ON right now, OS/Net, that\ns that core\nconsolidation that I talked about. But one of the ideas is that this also can\nthen ultimately build a community that can act as an umbrella for these other\nprojects, and other pieces, that become interesting, once you solve this\ncritical problem of that core foundation. X11, which is basically the graphical\nwindowing system. The desktop components. The C runtime. Some of the\ndistributions. And there is potentially a lot of ways which people can\ninnovate, and contribute. Which unfortunately, in the current community is\nquite difficult to do. We hope that we can become a lot more of a facilitator\nin that kind of development and collaboration.\n\n[Slide 7, 10:16]\n\nSo, around this, we hope to build a community. And, I think we actually have\nreally started one pretty strongly, from the people who have already either\nagreed to participate or are participating. And this community stands\nindependently from the OpenSolaris community. What that means is that we own\nour own identity, and we can\nt be shut down, and we\nre not slaves to any\ncorporate master. And even though Nexenta is a major sponsor, and I\nm very\ngrateful that Nexenta is. They\nre my employer, and they are funding my time on\nthis. But the identity and the project, is owned by the community. And that\nmeans we\nre governed and run by the community. On that topic, I have a few\nbullet points there about our resources being distributed, the fact that we\nre\ngoing to basically run this as a Meritocracy, with a light hand on governance,\nwhich is one of the areas we think we can improve upon from the previous\nattempts.\n\n[Slide 8, 11:28]\n\nSo there\ns a large number of people. I started the project, so I guess I\nm the\ndefactor \nleader\n. But you know, there\ns actually quite a - it was a dozen when\nI wrote this, it\ns probably grown since then. This project started out with\njust a few developers, that I wanted have real focus on just getting the code\ndone. Without engaging in a lot of conversation. Even with that small, focused\ngroup, it\ns already still growing. And now, today, as of right this minute, we\nhope to engage a much much broader audience. A we hope to invite, all of you -\nactually we do invite all of you. So come join us. In this presentation you\nll\nsee there\ns a website you can join, there\ns mailing lists you can join. A\nnumber of the community leaders, a lot of whom you will be familiar with, if\nyou\nre already a part of this group. In fact, hang on just a minute. Some of\nthem are on this call. And actually we have a couple who have agreed to speak.\nI\nd like to tie in one. Anil\ns checking on it for me. Just a minute.\n\n[12:48]\n\nSimon, we\nre going to go ahead and un-mute your mic. Are you available to talk?\nOk, great. So Simon Phipps is one of the - he didn\nt start out as an existing\ncore member. But he\ns agreed to help us out, and as you\nll see later, he\ns\nagreed to take a role in this, and I\nm hoping that Simon has some good things\nto say.\n\n*\nSimon Phipps, SP\n* Hi Garrett.\n\n*\nGDA\n* Simon Phipps, maybe not the best introduction.\n\n*\nSP\n* I\nm very pleased that you\nre doing this, Garrett. You know I\nve seen a\nproject like this before, when we started OpenJDK there was some concern, that\nSun wasn\nt going to get around to opening all of the Java code, so some\ncommunity members got together and formed a project called \nIcedTea\n, which was\ndownstream of OpenJDK, but to which people could innovate and could fix the\nnon-free parts of OpenJDK. It was the existence of that project, that made\nOpenJDK a fully free project, and led to it having the existence beyond the\nsponsorship that Sun put into it. I\nm looking at Illumos at the moment, and I\nthink it\ns exactly the right step to take. It\ns good that it\ns downstream of\nOracle. If they choose to use it, it could do a great deal of good to their\nSolaris products. If they choose not to use it, then it\ns a great place for the\ncommunity to assemble, and give a future to Solaris.\n\n*\nGDA\n* Ok. Great. And thanks for your support. That was Simon Phipps. Simon\ncurrently sits on the board for the Open Source Initiative. I think that\ns\ncorrect, is that correct, Simon?\n\n*\nSP\n* That\ns correct. I\nm on the board of directors of OSI, the Open Source\nInitiative. At the moment, while we still have one, I\nm a member of the\nOpenSolaris Governing Board, as well.\n\n*\nGDA\n* Ok. And he also writes for Computer World UK. I\nm sure you can find his\nblog pretty easily. Thank you very much Simon. Let\ns go ahead and move along.\nOne of the points that\ns on there, before I switch to the next slide, is that I\nbelieve that we actually do already have critical mass to drive this project\nforward. That\ns one of the real challenges for a project like this. The\ncodebase, when you look at the size of OS/Net, is quite enormous, but the\nnumber of people, and people who are actual do-ers rather than talk-ers, who\nare involved and interested and engaged, already, is - I\nm actually astounded,\nand thrilled to have such a - frankly an illustrious group of contributors\ninvolved. I have great hope. Moving forward.\n\n[Slide 9, 15:50]\n\nWe have quite a few community partners. Of course, Nexenta is one of these, and\nthere\ns a number of these names that you will recognise, if you\nre familiar\nwith the OpenSolaris community. Google is great at filling each one of these\nout. I\nm not going to present all of them to you. But I\nm really pleased that a\nformer colleague of mine at Oracle, is with us, and he has taken a position as\nVice President of Engineering at Joyent. Hopefully he\ns on the line. His name\nis Brian Cantrill. He\ns one of the co-creators of DTrace as I understand it.\nCan we un-mute his mic? We\nre having some technical issues here, hopefully\nwe\nll get Brian in, in a few minutes. In the meantime, I\nm going to go ahead\nand move on.\n\n[Slide 10, 16:52]\n\nThe 800 pound gorilla. This is the question that is probably on a lot of\npeople\ns minds. The 800 pound gorilla being that company that bought former\nowner of the Intellectual Property behind most of OpenSolaris, Oracle. The\ninteractions here, it\ns really important that we understand what these\ninteractions are, and what they\nre intended to be. The first of these is that\nIllumos is not a competitor to Solaris. Neither to OpenSolaris. In fact, I have\npersonally invited Oracle to participate as a peer, although they don\nt get to\nown it, we would love to have their participation. To the extent that they are\nallowed to, per whatever arrangements they have with Oracle, welcome the\nindividual employees of Oracle, to participate here as well. We\nd love to have\na collaborative and cooperative relationship with Oracle. Just as with any of\nour other corporate partners. From that slide I just had, you can see a few.\nThat slide, by the way, is by no means complete. I hope that it will not be the\nend statement, either. But we\nre not going to depend on them. I\nm being told\nnow that Brian is available, so I\nm going to go ahead and switch back to Brian.\n\n[18:12]\n\n*\nBryan Cantrill, BC\n* Hey Garrett. This is terrific news. A great development\nfor the OpenSolaris community. Looking back, historically, I think we at Sun (I\nshould say \nthey\n now I guess) - I think that Sun understood the importance of\nthe right to fork the operating system, but I think we\nve underestimated the\nimportance of the power to fork the operating system. As you know, as we all\nknow, we never quite made it to 100% of the source. And what that, effectively,\nforbid - not explicitly, I mean we didn\nt do it by design - but because there\nwere these encumbrances that didn\nt allow us to open source elements of the\noperating system, it effectively did not allow for a fork. A fork is a really\nimportant check against an open source project. A fork is what allows people to\ninnovate. A fork is what allows people to not get hung up on governance models.\nIt allows them to express their independence from a project. Whilst people had\nthe right, strictly speaking, they didn\nt have the power, because it was not\nall open source. Today is a really critical development. It is giving all of\nus, in the community, the power to fork the system. Not that we want to\nactually exercise that power in a way that is divisive, but we need to be able\nto exercise that power in a way that is innovative. I think that is going to\nallow many of us - now speaking as Joyent - many of us in the community who\ndepend on the innovations in this system for the value that we bring to our\ncustomers, it is going to allow all of us to begin to differentiate ourselves\nin the marketplace, it\ns going to allow all of us to be able to really innovate\nto the operating system, and allows us all to collaborate. I think that,\nspeaking for Joyent, we have modifications to the system that we have not been\nable to integrate for a variety of reasons. We believe with Illumos - with the\nIllumos project - that we will be able to begin to integrate some of these\nmodifications. Many of them, of course, are small - bugfixes and so on. But\nthings that for a variety of reasons couldn\nt be taken further upstream. I,\npersonally, and we, Joyent, are thrilled. This is a tremendous, tremendous\ndevelopment. Garrett, you and your team, are to be commended for some very\ndifficult technical work. To be clear, we are not completely out of the woods\nyet. We boot. That\ns good. But we got work ahead of us. Collectively. As a\ncommunity. To get to a vibrant base, that will allow for innovation. I\nm much\nmore confident now, than I have been at any time in the last five years, that\nwe\nre going to get there as a community. So, very exciting development, and I\nthink you see the number of people that are on Freenode. A lot of folks are\ninterested in this. I think for us as a community it\ns a real reboot. We owe\nour debt of gratitude to Garrett and the Illumos project.\n\n[21:44]\n\n*\nGDA\n* Thank you very much, Brian. I\nm very, very pleased that you and the\nrest of the crew at Joyent are going to be able to join us, and collaborate to\nexpand upon the great work that is already part of SunOS base. With that, I\nm\ngoing to go ahead and switch back, because I want to keep moving ahead. On this\none slide, the 800 pound gorilla. So I think that this idea that Brian really\nhit on, is that we have the power to fork. We are not a fork, but what we do is\nwe represent the ability of the community to do that. That\ns key.\n\n[Slide 11, 22:30]\n\nIn fact, here\ns my top slide on that. What if the tap is turned off? What if,\nthe upstream, ceases to be cooperative, or just goes away. For a lot of\nreasons, I don\nt think that\ns going to happen. Even if the community around\nthat code-base were to be abandoned, or shut down - or even change it\ns\ncharacter in a way that it might be hard to recognise it, the code-base, I\nexpect personally, for that to remain available. That code that is already\navailable, and for it to continue to be updated, on some level of frequency.\nBut in the event, that it were to go away, we believe that with the developers\nwe have, and especially, the growing ecosystem that already just on day one\nhere, seems to be exploding. I think we have critical mass to continue to\nsustain it. As I said, I\nm thrilled that Joyent, and there is a bunch of other\npeople, are a part of that. Of course, if this happens, then we - by definition\n- become a fork. We are not a fork today, because of the way we track OS/Net.\nIn my mind, in a classical sense, a fork starts from the starting point, and\nmoves away, and becomes something else. So we\nre more like a project that -\nwe\nre going to continue to try to work closely with Oracle. As I think that\nBrian talked about, really the idea is that Illumos is the insurance that the\nentire community needs, against this sort of scenario of what happens if the\ntap is turned off.\n\n[Slide 12, 24:14]\n\nWhat are some of the major goals of this project. I think we\nve already talked\nabout some of these. We want to be a self-hosting SunOS derivative. We\nre not\nquite there yet, but we\nre getting there. We\nve made good strides. Fully open\nsource, of course. That\ns kind of, I think, a key thing. I already touched on\nthe 100% ABI compatibility with Solaris. So, for those who are listening in,\nand aren\nt familiar with the acronym ABI, that\ns Application Binary\nInterface, and really what it means, is that your existing applications work\nwithout being recompiled. This next, fourth bullet point, I haven\nt touched on\nit today, and it\ns really key. Probably it deserves a little bit of discussion.\nThat is, that we want the things that we put into Illumos to be usable by\nOracle. To be able to be taken back into the upstream code from Oracle. This is\npart of the - we\nre not a fork today. Working and collaborate in a\ncollaborative relationship with Oracle. So there\ns a bunch of other\nconsequences that fall out of this. But the key thing is that the code that\nintegrates into Illumos really should be - it should be reasonable for somebody\nto integrate that back into the Oracle code base. If whatever political or\nbusiness goals, that were preventing that, were removed. Of course, we don\nt\nwant to have any corporate dependencies on the Illumos project. I think I\nve\nalready talked about this. This last bullet point, the basis for other\ndistributions. For people not familiar with the way OpenSolaris distributions\nare built today, there is typically this bottom piece, called ON. And there is\na bunch of other pieces, that are put together, and then these are all\nconstructed together, to create a full operating system. And there\ns a number\nof distributions besides the one that Oracle creates, called OpenSolaris.\nThere\ns Schillix, there\ns Belenix, and of course, my favourite, Nexenta. This\nis just a few of them. There\ns quite a few others. MilaX, EON, and we haven\nt\ntalked to all of the people producing these distributions, but at least the\nones that we have talked to are already engaged in looking at Illumos as their\nfuture base line. So they\nre participating. I\nm going to make a brief note\nhere, there is another individual who is a part of the Illumos developer\ncommunity, who\ns also working on a completely open, community driven, version\nof the distribution, formerly known as Indiana. I\nm not going to say anything\nmore about that, because that would be stealing his thunder. Hopefully, you\nll\nhear more from him in the coming days or weeks.\n\n[Slide 13, 27:10]\n\nA little bit here about how the project is organised. Basically, we\nre going to\nhave two groups, one group is this notion of administrative council, that\nbasically handles non-technical matters. So resource management. We do have\nservers, we have mailing lists. There is probably matters of evangelism and\nmarketing and all these others things that happen. We wanted to seperate the\ntechnical from the non-technical. So the people focused on the code, and\ngetting things done, didn\nt have to be bothered by the day-to-day running of\nthe details. Likewise, the people running the day-to-day details don\nt have to\nbe all-star developers. Initially, I\nm the chairman. It\ns a benevolent\ndictatorship until we come up with some other form of rule that works. The idea\nis to make this as much as possible, reasonable consensus driven, although\nthere will be a smaller group, that actually runs the administrative council. I\nhave already appointed a few members, that may change. Hopefully they will\nselect some additional members, to fill out their own ranks. The idea is a\nmeritocracy, the people who are actually helping to do things, rather than just\npeople who want to stand up and claim credit.\n\n[Slide 14, 28:35]\n\nThe other half of this is the developer council. I had a little tie-in from a\njoke here. A community member actually, had a nice tagline here, his name is\nMatthew, you\nll see him on IRC as lewellyn. His line was \nif you have a\npolarising issue, the first thing you have to work out if it\ns AC or DC\n.\nThanks to lewellyn for that little tid-bit. It\ns, again a benevolent\ndictatorship, and I\nm going to take the role as tech lead on the project. I\nll\nprobably keep that lead, longer than I will the leadership in the other side,\nbecause I really do view myself as a technical individual. Again, the initial\nmembers will be appointed. The idea is that this really made up of the\ndevelopers who have the ability and - not just the ability - but the right to\ncommit, and a consensus driven meritocracy. My hope is that as tech lead, I\nhelp define direction, but I only get involved in arbitration if no other\nalternative, solution can be arrived at via consensus.\n\n[29:55]\n\nI\nm seeing something on my UI here that says that we may be having network\ntrouble. Can somebody indicate on the IRC channel, am I coming across clearly?\nOk. Anil\ns giving the thumbs up. So I\nm going to keep going. Maybe it\ns not too\nbad.\n\n[Slide 15, 30:10]\n\nRules for integration. This is getting down to the nuts and bolts of how we\nexpect to operate. As I think I already mentioned, again ON here is OS/Net.\nThat\ns that consolidation from the upstream. We have the same kind of\nguidelines. You still gotta pass your cstyle, lint, you know, test your code,\nhave it reviewed, so forth. We do have some license restrictions, and really\nthese have a lot to do with this goal of making it easy for Oracle to take our\ncode and re-integrate it back into the upstream.\n\n\n\n\nCredits\n\n\n\n\nBrian Bienvenu (taemun)\n\n\nA.

We had some technology challenges such as, such as it\ngoes in our industry, and I apologise for the late start but here we are\nanyway.\n\nSo Illumos. First off I do want to point out before we get started, that there\nis a Q   A window in the Go2 webinar screen and Anil who is helping me out\nhere, is monitoring that. You can ask questions there and he will forward them\nto me. We also have a backchannel on IRC if you go to irc.freenode.net and the\nback channel is #illumos. I-L-L-U-M-O-S, and Anil s monitoring that as well,\nand he ll let me know if there s pertinent questions I should address. I will\ntry to address those questions at the end, however.\n\n[Slide 1, 1:06]\n\nSo, without further adieu, let s go ahead and continue. So, thanks for joining\nus. I think that the topic there on the first page slide, hopefully everybody\nsees it. By the way if you aren t able to see the slides now, we will be\nposting them up, excuse me Anil have you already posted those? Ok, so Anil with\npost them momentarily. So, hopefully you can get them, and they ll be on the\nwebsite at www.illumos.org. Just looking at that font on the slide, and realize\nthe  I  really doesn t stand out vary differently from the  L.  I apologize for\nthat, it s I-L-L. And our topic is  Hope and Light Springs Anew. \n\nSo, the name... well first off I hope everyone understands that this\npresentation is targeted towards the OpenSolaris audience so I didn t really go\ninto a lot of background there. It will become clear as we go on. If you are\nhere asking about Windows or something else you re probably in the wrong\nconference call.\n\n[Slide 2, 2:19]\n\nSo what s in a name? First  Illum  from Latin for  Light  and  OS  for Operating System.  However even though I printed it out this way on the slide,\nnow we ve been spelling it all one word with any unusual spellings, so\nI-L-L-U-M-O-S, with only the  I  capitalized.\n\n[Slide 3, 2:41]\n\nSo, actually what is this project about? Well the first thing is that the\nproject is designed here to solve a key problem, and that is that not all of\nOpenSolaris is really open source. And there s a lot of other potential\nconcerns in the community, but this one is really kind of a core one, and from\nsolving this, I think a lot of other issues can be solved. So the critical\ncomponents of OpenSolaris. Well, first off I guess I should say that most of\nthe important parts of OpenSolaris are, for booting at least and for building a\nfoundation block for the OS/Net consolidation, out of that consolidation it s\nnearly completely open source, except for a few pieces. One of the most\nstriking pieces is this part called  libc-i18n,  which is a component you need\nto build a working C library. It s a substantial percentage of libc is tied up\nin that libc-i18n, in some cases because it s i18n code, in other cases because\nof dependencies and well dependencies is probably the best way to put it.\n\nThe NFS lock manager, of course, there s the crypto framework, a number of\nreally important drivers. mpt I listed here is a pretty famous one its for a\npretty popular series of HBAs from LSI. But there s a lot of other drivers that\nare closed source, and in fact even some key platform code, although that s for\nthe most port an issue for the SPARC port. Most of the critical platform code\nfor x86 is open, in fact I can t think of anything critical that s closed.\nThis list is by no means exhaustive, but it s a good start.\n\nSo the problem with the fact that not all of this source is open is that it\nreally does present some big challenges to anyone downstream or who depends on\nOS/Net or consequently OpenSolaris and of course this involves Nexenta,\nBelinux, Schillix these are all derivative distributions from the original\nsource from Oracle. And this problem is not new to the industry; some years ago\nApple had done the community a great favor by opening a bunch of their code in\nthe form of Darwin. However I think you can Google around for MacOS X and\nDarwin and see the end result of that. And that is, the end result, I think,\nthat we would all like to avoid.\n\n[Slide 4, 5:32]\n\nSo there s a lot of good stuff, with all the other issues going on with the\ncommunity that s built up around the code. First off there s technology in\nthe code, zfs, dtrace, crossbow, zones, I think everyone who s familiar with\nOpensolaris will recognize this stuff, and if you don t, Google will readily\nfill you in with lots and lots of detail on all of these technologies, and this\nis just a brief list of some of the big names. There s a lot of others beyond\nthis. And of course the community behind these technologies is made up of a\nnumber of just incredible engineers, I ve been fortunate to work with some of\nthe brightest people on the planet, I believe, on Solaris and SunOS code. And\nwe are also backed by an outstanding set of enthusiasts, and our eco-system\nreally is quite vibrant, particularly in light of some of the other challenges\nit continues to be so vibrant. This I think says a lot. And of course the other\nthing is that it s not all closed. In fact, the vast majority of the code is\nindeed open. So the problem of, the problem faced to resolve this is actually\nquite tractable.\n\n[Slide 5, 7:06]\n\nTechnology issues, there it goes, alright. I apologise. OK. So around this\neffort. I talked a little about the issue of the code. To elaborate a little\nbit further, what we ve done is taken OS/Net, this consolidation which really\nmakes up the kernel and a bunch of critical system utilities and made a child\nof it, and this is really a source code management type term but what it means\nis that it has an ancestry relationship with the upstream which in this case is\nthe code from Oracle, and we track the upstream very closely, and we also have\nthe goal of being 100% compatible with the code from Oracle. I say ABI\ncompatible, what that means is that the idea is that you can take an\napplication that is compiled and runs well on Solaris, and the same exact\napplication compiles and runs on Illumos, so that is an important point.\n\nWe also, the idea is no closed code. There s a fully open libc, I would want to\nhave a fully open kernel, and fully open drivers. As you ll see we are not all\nthe way there yet but we made really good progress, and continue to work on\nthis. The other idea is that this project then becomes a repository where we\ncan take changes from contributors that for a variety of reasons might be\nunacceptable to Oracle, and I can detail all those later, maybe in Q   A or\nmaybe separately. There s a lot of potential possibilities here, and as long as\nwe don t really break the idea of ABI compatibility with Solaris and we don t\ndiverge needlessly from the upstream ON consolidation, there s a lot of room\nfor innovation.\n\n[Slide 6, 9:19]\n\nSo the focus of Illumos is really ON right now, OS/Net, that s that core\nconsolidation that I talked about. But one of the ideas is that this also can\nthen ultimately build a community that can act as an umbrella for these other\nprojects, and other pieces, that become interesting, once you solve this\ncritical problem of that core foundation. X11, which is basically the graphical\nwindowing system. The desktop components. The C runtime. Some of the\ndistributions. And there is potentially a lot of ways which people can\ninnovate, and contribute. Which unfortunately, in the current community is\nquite difficult to do. We hope that we can become a lot more of a facilitator\nin that kind of development and collaboration.\n\n[Slide 7, 10:16]\n\nSo, around this, we hope to build a community. And, I think we actually have\nreally started one pretty strongly, from the people who have already either\nagreed to participate or are participating. And this community stands\nindependently from the OpenSolaris community. What that means is that we own\nour own identity, and we can t be shut down, and we re not slaves to any\ncorporate master. And even though Nexenta is a major sponsor, and I m very\ngrateful that Nexenta is. They re my employer, and they are funding my time on\nthis. But the identity and the project, is owned by the community. And that\nmeans we re governed and run by the community. On that topic, I have a few\nbullet points there about our resources being distributed, the fact that we re\ngoing to basically run this as a Meritocracy, with a light hand on governance,\nwhich is one of the areas we think we can improve upon from the previous\nattempts.\n\n[Slide 8, 11:28]\n\nSo there s a large number of people. I started the project, so I guess I m the\ndefactor  leader . But you know, there s actually quite a - it was a dozen when\nI wrote this, it s probably grown since then. This project started out with\njust a few developers, that I wanted have real focus on just getting the code\ndone. Without engaging in a lot of conversation. Even with that small, focused\ngroup, it s already still growing. And now, today, as of right this minute, we\nhope to engage a much much broader audience. A we hope to invite, all of you -\nactually we do invite all of you. So come join us. In this presentation you ll\nsee there s a website you can join, there s mailing lists you can join. A\nnumber of the community leaders, a lot of whom you will be familiar with, if\nyou re already a part of this group. In fact, hang on just a minute. Some of\nthem are on this call. And actually we have a couple who have agreed to speak.\nI d like to tie in one. Anil s checking on it for me. Just a minute.\n\n[12:48]\n\nSimon, we re going to go ahead and un-mute your mic. Are you available to talk?\nOk, great. So Simon Phipps is one of the - he didn t start out as an existing\ncore member. But he s agreed to help us out, and as you ll see later, he s\nagreed to take a role in this, and I m hoping that Simon has some good things\nto say.\n\n* Simon Phipps, SP * Hi Garrett.\n\n* GDA * Simon Phipps, maybe not the best introduction.\n\n* SP * I m very pleased that you re doing this, Garrett. You know I ve seen a\nproject like this before, when we started OpenJDK there was some concern, that\nSun wasn t going to get around to opening all of the Java code, so some\ncommunity members got together and formed a project called  IcedTea , which was\ndownstream of OpenJDK, but to which people could innovate and could fix the\nnon-free parts of OpenJDK. It was the existence of that project, that made\nOpenJDK a fully free project, and led to it having the existence beyond the\nsponsorship that Sun put into it. I m looking at Illumos at the moment, and I\nthink it s exactly the right step to take. It s good that it s downstream of\nOracle. If they choose to use it, it could do a great deal of good to their\nSolaris products. If they choose not to use it, then it s a great place for the\ncommunity to assemble, and give a future to Solaris.\n\n* GDA * Ok. Great. And thanks for your support. That was Simon Phipps. Simon\ncurrently sits on the board for the Open Source Initiative. I think that s\ncorrect, is that correct, Simon?\n\n* SP * That s correct. I m on the board of directors of OSI, the Open Source\nInitiative. At the moment, while we still have one, I m a member of the\nOpenSolaris Governing Board, as well.\n\n* GDA * Ok. And he also writes for Computer World UK. I m sure you can find his\nblog pretty easily. Thank you very much Simon. Let s go ahead and move along.\nOne of the points that s on there, before I switch to the next slide, is that I\nbelieve that we actually do already have critical mass to drive this project\nforward. That s one of the real challenges for a project like this. The\ncodebase, when you look at the size of OS/Net, is quite enormous, but the\nnumber of people, and people who are actual do-ers rather than talk-ers, who\nare involved and interested and engaged, already, is - I m actually astounded,\nand thrilled to have such a - frankly an illustrious group of contributors\ninvolved. I have great hope. Moving forward.\n\n[Slide 9, 15:50]\n\nWe have quite a few community partners. Of course, Nexenta is one of these, and\nthere s a number of these names that you will recognise, if you re familiar\nwith the OpenSolaris community. Google is great at filling each one of these\nout. I m not going to present all of them to you. But I m really pleased that a\nformer colleague of mine at Oracle, is with us, and he has taken a position as\nVice President of Engineering at Joyent. Hopefully he s on the line. His name\nis Brian Cantrill. He s one of the co-creators of DTrace as I understand it.\nCan we un-mute his mic? We re having some technical issues here, hopefully\nwe ll get Brian in, in a few minutes. In the meantime, I m going to go ahead\nand move on.\n\n[Slide 10, 16:52]\n\nThe 800 pound gorilla. This is the question that is probably on a lot of\npeople s minds. The 800 pound gorilla being that company that bought former\nowner of the Intellectual Property behind most of OpenSolaris, Oracle. The\ninteractions here, it s really important that we understand what these\ninteractions are, and what they re intended to be. The first of these is that\nIllumos is not a competitor to Solaris. Neither to OpenSolaris. In fact, I have\npersonally invited Oracle to participate as a peer, although they don t get to\nown it, we would love to have their participation. To the extent that they are\nallowed to, per whatever arrangements they have with Oracle, welcome the\nindividual employees of Oracle, to participate here as well. We d love to have\na collaborative and cooperative relationship with Oracle. Just as with any of\nour other corporate partners. From that slide I just had, you can see a few.\nThat slide, by the way, is by no means complete. I hope that it will not be the\nend statement, either. But we re not going to depend on them. I m being told\nnow that Brian is available, so I m going to go ahead and switch back to Brian.\n\n[18:12]\n\n* Bryan Cantrill, BC * Hey Garrett. This is terrific news. A great development\nfor the OpenSolaris community. Looking back, historically, I think we at Sun (I\nshould say  they  now I guess) - I think that Sun understood the importance of\nthe right to fork the operating system, but I think we ve underestimated the\nimportance of the power to fork the operating system. As you know, as we all\nknow, we never quite made it to 100% of the source. And what that, effectively,\nforbid - not explicitly, I mean we didn t do it by design - but because there\nwere these encumbrances that didn t allow us to open source elements of the\noperating system, it effectively did not allow for a fork. A fork is a really\nimportant check against an open source project. A fork is what allows people to\ninnovate. A fork is what allows people to not get hung up on governance models.\nIt allows them to express their independence from a project. Whilst people had\nthe right, strictly speaking, they didn t have the power, because it was not\nall open source. Today is a really critical development. It is giving all of\nus, in the community, the power to fork the system. Not that we want to\nactually exercise that power in a way that is divisive, but we need to be able\nto exercise that power in a way that is innovative. I think that is going to\nallow many of us - now speaking as Joyent - many of us in the community who\ndepend on the innovations in this system for the value that we bring to our\ncustomers, it is going to allow all of us to begin to differentiate ourselves\nin the marketplace, it s going to allow all of us to be able to really innovate\nto the operating system, and allows us all to collaborate. I think that,\nspeaking for Joyent, we have modifications to the system that we have not been\nable to integrate for a variety of reasons. We believe with Illumos - with the\nIllumos project - that we will be able to begin to integrate some of these\nmodifications. Many of them, of course, are small - bugfixes and so on. But\nthings that for a variety of reasons couldn t be taken further upstream. I,\npersonally, and we, Joyent, are thrilled. This is a tremendous, tremendous\ndevelopment. Garrett, you and your team, are to be commended for some very\ndifficult technical work. To be clear, we are not completely out of the woods\nyet. We boot. That s good. But we got work ahead of us. Collectively. As a\ncommunity. To get to a vibrant base, that will allow for innovation. I m much\nmore confident now, than I have been at any time in the last five years, that\nwe re going to get there as a community. So, very exciting development, and I\nthink you see the number of people that are on Freenode. A lot of folks are\ninterested in this. I think for us as a community it s a real reboot. We owe\nour debt of gratitude to Garrett and the Illumos project.\n\n[21:44]\n\n* GDA * Thank you very much, Brian. I m very, very pleased that you and the\nrest of the crew at Joyent are going to be able to join us, and collaborate to\nexpand upon the great work that is already part of SunOS base. With that, I m\ngoing to go ahead and switch back, because I want to keep moving ahead. On this\none slide, the 800 pound gorilla. So I think that this idea that Brian really\nhit on, is that we have the power to fork. We are not a fork, but what we do is\nwe represent the ability of the community to do that. That s key.\n\n[Slide 11, 22:30]\n\nIn fact, here s my top slide on that. What if the tap is turned off? What if,\nthe upstream, ceases to be cooperative, or just goes away. For a lot of\nreasons, I don t think that s going to happen. Even if the community around\nthat code-base were to be abandoned, or shut down - or even change it s\ncharacter in a way that it might be hard to recognise it, the code-base, I\nexpect personally, for that to remain available. That code that is already\navailable, and for it to continue to be updated, on some level of frequency.\nBut in the event, that it were to go away, we believe that with the developers\nwe have, and especially, the growing ecosystem that already just on day one\nhere, seems to be exploding. I think we have critical mass to continue to\nsustain it. As I said, I m thrilled that Joyent, and there is a bunch of other\npeople, are a part of that. Of course, if this happens, then we - by definition\n- become a fork. We are not a fork today, because of the way we track OS/Net.\nIn my mind, in a classical sense, a fork starts from the starting point, and\nmoves away, and becomes something else. So we re more like a project that -\nwe re going to continue to try to work closely with Oracle. As I think that\nBrian talked about, really the idea is that Illumos is the insurance that the\nentire community needs, against this sort of scenario of what happens if the\ntap is turned off.\n\n[Slide 12, 24:14]\n\nWhat are some of the major goals of this project. I think we ve already talked\nabout some of these. We want to be a self-hosting SunOS derivative. We re not\nquite there yet, but we re getting there. We ve made good strides. Fully open\nsource, of course. That s kind of, I think, a key thing. I already touched on\nthe 100% ABI compatibility with Solaris. So, for those who are listening in,\nand aren t familiar with the acronym ABI, that s Application Binary\nInterface, and really what it means, is that your existing applications work\nwithout being recompiled. This next, fourth bullet point, I haven t touched on\nit today, and it s really key. Probably it deserves a little bit of discussion.\nThat is, that we want the things that we put into Illumos to be usable by\nOracle. To be able to be taken back into the upstream code from Oracle. This is\npart of the - we re not a fork today. Working and collaborate in a\ncollaborative relationship with Oracle. So there s a bunch of other\nconsequences that fall out of this. But the key thing is that the code that\nintegrates into Illumos really should be - it should be reasonable for somebody\nto integrate that back into the Oracle code base. If whatever political or\nbusiness goals, that were preventing that, were removed. Of course, we don t\nwant to have any corporate dependencies on the Illumos project. I think I ve\nalready talked about this. This last bullet point, the basis for other\ndistributions. For people not familiar with the way OpenSolaris distributions\nare built today, there is typically this bottom piece, called ON. And there is\na bunch of other pieces, that are put together, and then these are all\nconstructed together, to create a full operating system. And there s a number\nof distributions besides the one that Oracle creates, called OpenSolaris.\nThere s Schillix, there s Belenix, and of course, my favourite, Nexenta. This\nis just a few of them. There s quite a few others. MilaX, EON, and we haven t\ntalked to all of the people producing these distributions, but at least the\nones that we have talked to are already engaged in looking at Illumos as their\nfuture base line. So they re participating. I m going to make a brief note\nhere, there is another individual who is a part of the Illumos developer\ncommunity, who s also working on a completely open, community driven, version\nof the distribution, formerly known as Indiana. I m not going to say anything\nmore about that, because that would be stealing his thunder. Hopefully, you ll\nhear more from him in the coming days or weeks.\n\n[Slide 13, 27:10]\n\nA little bit here about how the project is organised. Basically, we re going to\nhave two groups, one group is this notion of administrative council, that\nbasically handles non-technical matters. So resource management. We do have\nservers, we have mailing lists. There is probably matters of evangelism and\nmarketing and all these others things that happen. We wanted to seperate the\ntechnical from the non-technical. So the people focused on the code, and\ngetting things done, didn t have to be bothered by the day-to-day running of\nthe details. Likewise, the people running the day-to-day details don t have to\nbe all-star developers. Initially, I m the chairman. It s a benevolent\ndictatorship until we come up with some other form of rule that works. The idea\nis to make this as much as possible, reasonable consensus driven, although\nthere will be a smaller group, that actually runs the administrative council. I\nhave already appointed a few members, that may change. Hopefully they will\nselect some additional members, to fill out their own ranks. The idea is a\nmeritocracy, the people who are actually helping to do things, rather than just\npeople who want to stand up and claim credit.\n\n[Slide 14, 28:35]\n\nThe other half of this is the developer council. I had a little tie-in from a\njoke here. A community member actually, had a nice tagline here, his name is\nMatthew, you ll see him on IRC as lewellyn. His line was  if you have a\npolarising issue, the first thing you have to work out if it s AC or DC .\nThanks to lewellyn for that little tid-bit. It s, again a benevolent\ndictatorship, and I m going to take the role as tech lead on the project. I ll\nprobably keep that lead, longer than I will the leadership in the other side,\nbecause I really do view myself as a technical individual. Again, the initial\nmembers will be appointed. The idea is that this really made up of the\ndevelopers who have the ability and - not just the ability - but the right to\ncommit, and a consensus driven meritocracy. My hope is that as tech lead, I\nhelp define direction, but I only get involved in arbitration if no other\nalternative, solution can be arrived at via consensus.\n\n[29:55]\n\nI m seeing something on my UI here that says that we may be having network\ntrouble. Can somebody indicate on the IRC channel, am I coming across clearly?\nOk. Anil s giving the thumbs up. So I m going to keep going. Maybe it s not too\nbad.\n\n[Slide 15, 30:10]\n\nRules for integration. This is getting down to the nuts and bolts of how we\nexpect to operate. As I think I already mentioned, again ON here is OS/Net.\nThat s that consolidation from the upstream. We have the same kind of\nguidelines. You still gotta pass your cstyle, lint, you know, test your code,\nhave it reviewed, so forth. We do have some license restrictions, and really\nthese have a lot to do with this goal of making it easy for Oracle to take our\ncode and re-integrate it back into the upstream.",

It included a section on the Quality Death Spiral -- a\ntimeless phenomenon that remains our omnipresent fear:  if it s broken, rip it out\n\n    - FCS* quality all the time\n    - put it back today, 20 of your (current) friends\n        will be running it tomorrow\n    - gate breakage grinds other development to a halt\n    - the product, not any one project, is what matters\n    - mistakes will happen; negligence cannot\n\nFCS* quality all the time -- why is this so important?\n\n    - only way to avoid the quality death spiral:\n\n        - people hear the gate is broken\n        - decide not to risk a bringover\n        - fewer people run the latest stuff\n        - less real-life testing\n        - new bugs not found\n        - quality drops further\n\n    - morale tracks quality\n\n    - downward spiral hard to break\n\n    - recovery time can be very long   FCS == First Customer Ship   (Orignally sourced from  http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Community+Group+on/qual_death_spiral )",
