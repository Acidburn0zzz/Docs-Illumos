It began as a fork of the former \nOpenSolaris\n operating\nsystem.\n\n\nOur goal is to foster open development of technologies for the 21\nst\n century\nwhile building on a twenty-year heritage, but free from the oversight of a\nsingle corporate entity and the resulting challenges thereof.\n\n\nWhile our code base has a long history and many engineering traditions attached\nto it, our development processes are being reinvented in an attempt to remove\nbarriers while maintaining consistently high code quality.\n\n\nHow do I download the software?\n\n\nThe source code developed by the project is a fork of the Sun/Oracle code base\nreferred to as \"OS/Net\" or \"ON\" (short for Operating System/Networking). It is\nthe home of the technologies that previously defined OpenSolaris and Solaris,\nsuch as the kernel, network stack, filesystems, and device drivers, and all of\nthe basic userland libraries and applications.\n\n\nThe illumos code base forms the foundation of \ndistributions\n. To use the\noperating system, just download and install one of the distributions.\n\n\nTo download the source code, follow the section on Git or Mercurial in \nHow To\nBuild illumos\n. You can also \nbrowse and search the illumos code online\n.\n\n\nIs illumos free software (open source)?\n\n\nThe bulk of the illumos source code is available under the Common Development\nand Distribution License (CDDL), an OSI-approved free software license based on\nthe Mozilla Public License (MPL).\n\n\nThere are some components with other licenses including BSD and MIT. We also\ninclude some software with the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the\nLesser/Library General Public License (LGPL).\n\n\nThere still remain some binary-only, closed source components that we inherited\nfrom Oracle which we are working to replace. Unlike OpenSolaris, we do not\nrequire a closed source compiler.\n\n\nIs illumos a Nexenta or Joyent project?\n\n\nillumos was initiated by then-employees of Nexenta in collaboration with former\nOpenSolaris community members and volunteers. While companies including\nNexenta, Joyent, and Delphix sponsor some of the work in illumos, the project\nis independent of their business decisions. illumos exists as a common base for\nmultiple commercial and community distributions.\n\n\nIs illumos a community project?\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nMultiple community groups and interests (including people like you!) are\nstakeholders in the project, and anyone and everyone is welcome to contribute.\n\n\nHow do I start contributing?\n\n\nillumos thrives on the efforts of its contributors. Have a look at the guide on\n\nHow To Contribute\n if you want to submit code.\n\n\nIf you want to help in other ways then have a look at the \nMailing Lists\n.\n\n\nMost of the developers can be found on \nIRC\n and you're invited to drop in and\nsay \"hi!\"\n\n\nHow do I build illumos?\n\n\nSee \nHow To Build illumos\n.\n\n\nHow do I build a distribution based on illumos?\n\n\nOpenSolaris was historically difficult to build as a distribution because it\nwas assembled by many separate teams at Sun. The illumos community\ndistributions are working to make this easier.\n\n\nSome distributions have documented their build processes: \nOpenIndiana\n,\n\nOmniOS\n.\n\n\nIs illumos compatible with Solaris/OpenSolaris?\n\n\nillumos is very likely to be compatible with Solaris/OpenSolaris binaries and\ndrivers before Oracle closed the gate in 2010. After that, all bets are off.\nSolaris 10 update 11, and Solaris 11, and beyond, may contain incompatible\nchanges.\n\n\nWhat changes does illumos maintain?\n\n\n\n\nOpen internationalization libraries and data files.\n\n\nOpen replacements for closed binaries.\n\n\nCode that Oracle may choose to no longer maintain.\n\n\nCommunity enhancements to critical technologies like DTrace and ZFS.\n\n\nNew open technologies.\n\n\nPatches/bug-fixes we have independently developed, including security fixes.\n\n\nChanges to ease community development.\n\n\n...and more!\n\n\n\n\nWill you track Oracle changes?\n\n\nWe originally intended to closely follow upstream changes, but became a fork by\nnecessity because Oracle's software is no longer open source. We now represent\nthe open future of the code base after Sun.\n\n\nIt is uncertain if Oracle will ever open source their version of ON again. If\nthis happens in the future, their changes will be evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis for integration.\n\n\nWill you work on sending illumos changes upstream?\n\n\nWe would like Oracle to use changes from illumos, as long as they are willing\nto abide by the open source license for our code. Where we use code from other\nfree software projects, we also respect their licenses and keep the source\nopen.\n\n\nWhy did you announce the project after it was set up and much of the code written?\n\n\nThis decision was made for multiple reasons. The signal to noise ratio in the\nOpenSolaris community had grown low, and announcing the project would have\ndistracted the developers from actual code and contribution. Most vocal members\ntalked about opening the code rather than writing it. illumos chose the\nopposite. Before the formal announcement, we reached out to developers in the\ncommunity and solicited their help and participation.\n\n\nSome choices of project infrastructure were not made by a community vote - what drove these choices?\n\n\nThese initial infrastructure choices, of using hosting graciously provided by\nStanford University, and Redmine as the project management software to power\nthe projects and bug tracking were made by individuals in the project to get\nthe work done as quickly as possible. Redmine is easy to use, provides all\nrequired functionality in a single package, and we felt it was a good choice\nfor all planned illumos development.\n\n\nWe have since migrated to hosting facilities offered by Joyent, and are\nmigrating part of the content infrastructure from Redmine to this wiki and\nother tools.\n\n\nAnd the name illumos?\n\n\nWe started off with the codename \"FreeON\", and later realized it is used by an\n\nexisting project\n. We finally settled on illumos, after many hours of\nsuggestions and counter-suggestions. illumos (pronounced i-llu-MOS and written\nin lowercase) ties in with Sun and light. It's the closest to ON we could get!",
