![logo](images/logo.png) illumos is a Unix operating system which provides
next-generation operating system features for downstream
[distributions](about/distro.md), including [advanced system
debugging](http://dtrace.org/guide/), [next generation
filesystem](http://open-zfs.org/), networking, and virtualization options.

illumos is freely available from our [source
repository](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate), and most distributions
based on it are also open source. You can see recent changes
[here](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/commits/master).

illumos is [developed](about/who.d) by both volunteers and companies building
products on top of the software.

We believe in cross-pollinating technology and collaborating with other open
source projects.
