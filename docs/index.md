![logo](images/logo.png) illumos is a Unix operating system which provides
next-generation features for downstream [distributions](about/distro.md),
including [advanced system debugging](http://dtrace.org/guide/), [next
generation filesystem](http://open-zfs.org/), networking, and virtualization
options.

illumos is freely available from our [source
repository](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate), and most distributions
based on it are also open source. You can see recent changes
[here](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/commits/master).

illumos is [developed](about/who.md) by both volunteers and companies building
products on top of the software.

illumos is an excellent base for both traditional and cloud-native deployments.

We believe in [cross-pollination and collaboration](about/who.md#collaboration)
with other open source projects.

Please see the [about](about/index.md) page to learn more!
