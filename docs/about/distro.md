# the illumos family

Similar to other operating systems, there are many different OS distributions
based on the common illumos kernel. Some of them are maintained by enthusiasts,
others are primarily developed by commercial companies with their own
priorities and target products (i.e. storage, virtualization, etc.) with
different packaging systems (IPS, SVR4, DEB, RPM, etc). These projects
contribute back to the common core set of software which the illumos project is
about.

## SmartOS
