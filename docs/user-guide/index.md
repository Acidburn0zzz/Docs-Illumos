# Getting Started

## Introduction

As illumos is the core of an operating system -- but not a distribution itself,
the easiest way to get started with illumos is to [download a
distro](../about/distro.md) and start playing.

## Books

We provide a number of [books](./books.md) relating to illumos
technologies.

If your goal is to work on illumos itself, the [Developer's
Guide](https://illumos.org/books/dev/) or [building
illumos](../developers/index.md) are good places to get started.
