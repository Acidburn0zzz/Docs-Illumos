# Contributing Documentation

## Introduction

If you'd like to help expand our documentation, we'd love the assistance.

This site is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/illumos/docs/) and uses
[mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/).

## Process

If you notice an error or see something that can be improved, or you want to
write a whole new section, you have a couple options:

### Local Development

Fork the [illumos/docs](https://github.com/illumos/docs/) repo and submit a
Pull Request.

You'll need to [install mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation), and some
of our dependencies on your workstation to help with development and testing.

```
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
pip install markdown-include
```

We enable a number of extensions. You might want to review the documentation
for them. Some of the more useful ones are:

* https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/admonition/
* https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/codehilite/
* https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/pymdown/

### Online Development

Alternatively, you can edit the page directly in GitHub, and submit a Pull
Request.

### Review

Your changes will go through a review process and hopefully be merged in!

## Help Wanted!

We've already identified some key pages where we need to improve documentation;
have a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/illumos/docs/issues) for
the doc repository to see if you can lend a hand.
