# Contributing Documentation

## Introduction

If you'd like to help expand our documentation, we'd love the assistance.

## Process

If you notice an error or see something that can be improved, or you want to
write a whole new section, fork the
[illumos/docs](https://github.com/illumos/docs/) repo and submit a Pull
Request. Your changes will go through a review process and hopefully be merged
in!

## Help Wanted!

We've already identified some key pages where we need to improve documentation;
have a look at the [open issues]() for the doc repository to see if you can
lend a hand.
