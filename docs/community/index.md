# Community

## Introduction

The illumos community is small but active. From hobbyists to businesses pushing
massive cloud deployments, we welcome all comers.

We try to be very helpful and inclusive! It's not uncommon to see folks
answering questions ranging from newbie to helping debug complicated
deep-kernel black magic.
